# Trip_Planner

We did not have enough time to finish what we wanted to finish, but here is a product anyways!
My team - Anthony Esmeralda, Dan Tablac, and Tristan Samonte - utillized the GoogleMaps API
to create a Trip Planner, called "Don't Trip (We Got You)". Because UI got a little out of hand,
our program prints out an itinerary with locations near a specified area (i.e. a city), alongside
directions and commute times between each destination.

Run using the following command:
`python generatePlan.py`
